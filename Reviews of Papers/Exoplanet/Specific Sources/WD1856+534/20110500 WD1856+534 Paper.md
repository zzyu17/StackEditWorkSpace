**1 Core Information Summary**

*   **Research Question:** To provide improved theoretical limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) and gravity-darkening coefficients (GDCs) for modeling the light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits across multiple photometric systems.
    
*   **Methodology:** Calculations use ATLAS and PHOENIX plane-parallel stellar atmosphere models. LDCs are computed for five different limb-darkening laws (linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic, and a 4-term law) using both the least-squares method (LSM) and the flux conservation method (FCM). GDCs are computed using a more general differential equation that accounts for local gravity variations and the effects of convection. The parameter space covers a wide range of effective temperatures (2000–50,000 K), surface gravities ( $\log g = 0.0–5.0$ ), metallicities, and microturbulent velocities.
    
*   **Core Findings:**
    
    1.  Limb-darkening coefficients have been computed with higher numerical resolution (using  $100 \mu$  points) and are provided for the _Kepler_, CoRoT, _Spitzer_, Johnson-Cousins (_UBVRIJHK_), Strömgren (_uvby_), and Sloan photometric systems.
        
    2.  New gravity-darkening coefficients  $y(\lambda)$  are presented, calculated with a more general formula (Eq. 7) that includes the influence of local gravity and, critically, the effects of convection, which significantly alters results for cool stars.
        
    3.  The authors recommend using the 4-coefficient limb-darkening law (Eq. 5) for the best fit to model intensities when empirical constraints from light curves are lacking.
        
*   **Stated Limitations/Future Work:** The paper notes systematic disagreements between theoretical LDCs and some semi-empirical determinations, indicating potential issues with atmosphere models or the observational data itself. It suggests that comparisons between different numerical methods (LSM vs. FCM) and models (ATLAS vs. PHOENIX) can help delineate more realistic theoretical error bars.
    

**Relevance Assessment:** **8/10**. This paper is highly relevant as it provides the fundamental theoretical coefficients required for accurate modeling of transit light curves, which is the core of your TTV detection and analysis methodology for WD1856+534 b.

**Project Implications:**

1.  The provided LDC and GDC tables for the _Kepler_/TESS-like systems are **essential inputs** for your transit light curve fitting models when analyzing TESS data for WD1856+534.
    
2.  The discussion on different fitting methods (LSM vs. FCM) and the noted discrepancies with observations highlight the importance of **considering systematic errors** in your TTV measurements that may arise from limb-darkening parameterization.
    
3.  The updated treatment of **gravity-darkening**, including convection effects, may be particularly important for modeling the transit of a planet around a white dwarf (high-gravity object), as the local gravity variation across the stellar disk affects the observed flux.
