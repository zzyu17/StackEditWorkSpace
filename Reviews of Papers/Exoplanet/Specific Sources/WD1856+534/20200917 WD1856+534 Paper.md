### 1 Core Information Summary

**Research Question:** Can intact giant planets exist in close orbits around white dwarfs, and how do they arrive in such orbits given the destructive red giant phase of stellar evolution?

**Methodology:**

*   **Primary Data:** TESS photometry (sectors 14, 15, 19) for transit detection.
    
*   **Follow-up Observations:** Ground-based optical photometry (privately operated telescopes, GTC) and infrared photometry (Spitzer/IRAC at 4.5 µm) to confirm transits, measure depth, and constrain companion's thermal emission.
    
*   **Spectroscopy:** Multiple observatories (MMT, Lick, HET, Gemini) to classify the white dwarf (DC type) and search for atmospheric features.
    
*   **Analysis:** Transit modeling (MCMC) to derive orbital and physical parameters. Mass constraints from lack of detected infrared flux compared to brown dwarf/planet evolution models (Sonora, MESA grids). Investigation of formation mechanisms (common-envelope vs. dynamical scattering) via analytic calculations and N-body simulations.
    

**Core Findings:**

1.  **Detection:** Discovery of a Jupiter-sized transiting object (WD 1856 b) around the white dwarf WD 1856+534 with an orbital period of 1.4 days.
    
2.  **Mass Constraint:** The companion's mass is constrained to <14 M $_J$  (95% confidence), placing it in the planetary regime. This is based on the non-detection of its thermal emission in Spitzer data.
    
3.  **Formation Pathway:** Common-envelope evolution is energetically disfavored. The most probable origin is **dynamical scattering** from a wider orbit (>1 AU) into a high-eccentricity orbit, followed by tidal circularization.
    

**Stated Limitations/Future Work:**

*   Future observations (e.g., JWST transmission spectroscopy or more precise thermal flux measurements) are needed to definitively confirm the planetary nature and measure the mass of WD 1856 b.
    
*   The atmospheric composition of the white dwarf is not well constrained, affecting precise stellar parameter determination.
    

**Relevance Assessment:**  
**9/10** – This is the discovery paper for the exact system (WD1856+534) that is the core of the user's research topic. It establishes the system's existence, basic parameters, and suggests a dynamical history that could involve additional perturbing bodies—a direct motivator for TTV searches.

**Project Implications:**

1.  **Target Validation:** Confirms WD1856+534 b as a prime, validated target for TTV studies using TESS and ground-based data.
    
2.  **Dynamical Context:** The proposed dynamical scattering formation mechanism implies the past (and possibly present) existence of additional perturbing bodies (planets or stars) in the system, which could generate detectable TTVs.
    
3.  **Data Availability:** The paper confirms multiple sectors of TESS data exist (Sectors 14, 15, 19, 22, 26), providing the primary dataset for the user's proposed TTV analysis.
