### 1 Core Information Summary

**Research Question:** This paper aims to compute limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) and gravity-darkening coefficients (GDCs) for compact stars—specifically DA, DB, and DBA white dwarfs—to improve the modeling of light curves in eclipsing binaries, planetary transits, and other high-precision photometric studies.

**Methodology:** The authors computed model atmospheres for DA (hydrogen-dominated), DB (helium-dominated), and DBA (mixed hydrogen-helium) white dwarfs, covering effective temperatures  $T_{\text{eff}}$  from 3750 K to 100 000 K and surface gravities  $\log g$  from 5.0 to 9.5. They generated specific intensity distributions using 20  $\mu$  points, convolved with passbands of Sloan, UBVRI, HiPERCAM, Kepler, TESS, and Gaia. LDCs were fitted using six limb-darkening laws via the least-squares method. GDCs were derived from a more general equation that includes the partial derivative  $(\partial \ln I_c(\lambda)/\partial \ln g)_{T_{\text{eff}}}$ .

**Core Findings:**

1.  The four-term limb-darkening law (Eq. 6) provides significantly better fits than simpler biparametric laws, especially near the limb.
    
2.  Gravity-darkening coefficients computed with realistic atmosphere models deviate substantially from the classical blackbody approximation.
    
3.  The paper provides 112 tables of LDCs and GDCs for DA, DB, and DBA models across multiple photometric systems, including first-time calculations for GDCs in white dwarfs.
    

**Stated Limitations/Future Work:** The authors note that 3D convective effects are not yet included but plan to apply their techniques to existing 3D atmosphere grids in future work.

**Relevance Assessment:** **7/10** – The paper provides essential atmospheric coefficients for white dwarfs, which are directly applicable to transit light‑curve modeling of WD 1856+534 b, though the study does not specifically address planetary transits or TTVs.

**Project Implications:**

1.  The tabulated LDCs and GDCs can be used to accurately model the transit light curves of WD 1856+534 b, especially when fitting ingress/egress shapes.
    
2.  The recommendation to use the four‑term limb‑darkening law (Eq. 6) should be followed for high‑precision TTV analyses.

### 1 Structured Paper Summary

**Introduction**  
The paper addresses the lack of theoretical limb-darkening (LDC) and gravity-darkening (GDC) coefficients for compact stars, specifically white dwarfs (WDs) of spectral types DA, DB, and DBA. These coefficients are essential for high-precision modeling of light curves in eclipsing binaries, planetary transits, and other phenomena. Prior work focused mainly on main-sequence stars, with Gianninas et al. (2013) being a notable exception for DA WDs.

**Methods**  
The authors computed three grids of 1D model atmospheres (DA, DB, DBA) covering  $T_{\text{eff}}$  from 3750 K to 100 000 K and  $\log g$  from 5.0 to 9.5. For DA models with  $T_{\text{eff}} \geq 40\,000$  K, non-LTE (NLTE) models were also generated using TLUSTY. Specific intensities were calculated for 20  $\mu$  points ( $\mu = \cos \theta$ ) and convolved with the passbands of Sloan, UBVRI, HiPERCAM, Kepler, TESS, and Gaia. Six limb-darkening laws (linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic, power-2, and a four-term law) were fitted using the least-squares method on 100 interpolated  $\mu$  points. Gravity-darkening coefficients were derived from a generalized equation:

$$
y(\lambda) = \frac{\beta_1}{4} \left( \frac{\partial \ln I_c(\lambda)}{\partial \ln T_{\text{eff}}} \right)_g + \left( \frac{\partial \ln I_c(\lambda)}{\partial \ln g} \right)_{T_{\text{eff}}}
$$

where  $\beta_1$  is the bolometric gravity-darkening exponent.

**Results**

*   The four-term limb-darkening law (Eq. 6) provides a significantly better fit (merit function  $\chi^2$  orders of magnitude smaller) than biparametric laws, especially near the limb.
    
*   Gravity-darkening coefficients calculated with realistic atmosphere models deviate strongly from the classical blackbody approximation, particularly at shorter wavelengths.
    
*   Hydrogen content (DBA vs. DB) and NLTE effects (for hot DAs) measurably influence both LDCs and GDCs.
    
*   The study produces 112 tables of LDCs and GDCs for the aforementioned passbands and WD types.
    

**Discussion**  
The results agree well with prior work (Gianninas et al. 2013) for DA WDs. The authors interpret the differences in LDCs/GDCs across compositions and temperatures as potentially observable in high-quality light curves. They explicitly note the current neglect of 3D convective effects—a limitation for cooler WDs—and plan to address this in future work using existing 3D atmosphere grids.

**Conclusion**  
The paper delivers a comprehensive set of theoretical LDCs and GDCs for DA, DB, and DBA white dwarfs across major photometric systems. These data are critical for precise light-curve modeling of eclipsing WD binaries and transiting planetary systems. Future work will incorporate 3D atmospheric models.

### 2 Methodological Deep Dive

**Simplified Explanation of Framework**  
The core methodology involves generating detailed 1D atmospheric models to compute the specific intensity  $I(\mu, \lambda)$  emerging from a WD surface. This intensity distribution is then parameterized using established limb-darkening laws, with coefficients determined by fitting the model output. For gravity darkening, the method goes beyond the classical von Zeipel theorem by incorporating the partial dependence of intensity on surface gravity  $(\partial \ln I_c / \partial \ln g)$ , derived directly from the same atmosphere models.

**Key Technical Details**

*   **Atmosphere Codes**: The Montreal code (LTE; Tremblay & Bergeron 2009) for DA ( $\leq 40\,000$  K), DB, DBA grids, and TLUSTY (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) for NLTE DA models ( $> 40\,000$  K).
    
*   **Critical Parameters**: Mixing-length parameters ML2/ $\alpha = 0.8$  (DA) and 1.25 (DB, DBA); hydrogen abundances set to  $\log[\text{H/He}] = -10.0$  (DB),  $-2.0$  (DBA), and 0 (DA).
    
*   **Intensity Sampling**: Original calculation at 20 non-equally spaced  $\mu$  points, but fitting performed on 100 equally spaced  $\mu$  points via interpolation to avoid overweighting the limb.
    
*   **Fitting Procedure**: Least-squares minimization (Eq. 7,  $\chi^2$  merit function) applied to each law for each model and filter.
    
*   **GDC Calculation**: The two terms in Eq. 15 are tabulated separately, allowing users to adjust the bolometric exponent  $\beta_1$  during light-curve synthesis.
    

### 3 Critical Evaluation

**Strengths**

1.  **Novelty & Comprehensiveness**: First study to provide extensive LDCs and the first-ever GDCs for DB and DBA WDs, covering a broad parameter space and multiple modern photometric systems.
    
2.  **Methodological Rigor**: Use of updated atmosphere models and a more physically complete equation for GDCs that includes the  $(\partial \ln I_c / \partial \ln g)$  term.
    
3.  **Practical Utility**: The 112 tables are a major resource for observers. The explicit recommendation of the four-term law for accuracy is well-supported by their  $\chi^2$  analysis.
    

**Limitations**

1.  **1D Atmosphere Assumption**: The models are 1D, neglecting 3D convective effects which are significant for WDs with  $T_{\text{eff}} \lesssim 14\,000$  K (as noted by the authors).
    
2.  **Limited Composition Coverage**: The DBA grid uses a high hydrogen abundance ( $\log[\text{H/He}] = -2.0$ ) for testing, whereas typical DBAs show  $\log[\text{H/He}] \sim -4.0 \text{ to } -5.0$ . Coefficients for this realistic range are not provided.
    
3.  **Static Models**: The models do not account for atmospheric dynamics, magnetic fields, or accretion processes, which could affect the intensity distribution in specific systems (e.g., polluted WDs like WD 1145+017).
    

**Evidence Robustness**  
The conclusions are robust within the framework of 1D model atmospheres. The superiority of the four-term law is demonstrated quantitatively via  $\chi^2$  comparisons across the entire parameter grid (e.g., Figs. 3-5). Consistency checks against Gianninas et al. (2013) show good agreement (Fig. 7). However, the absence of 3D effects and the simplified treatment of convection mean the coefficients may have systematic errors for cooler WDs.

### 4 Research Connection & Relevance

**Hypothesis Alignment**  
The paper directly supports the user's hypothesis that precise transit modeling is required to detect TTVs of WD 1856+534 b. By providing accurate, composition-specific LDCs for DA WDs (the spectral type of WD 1856+534), it removes a major source of systematic error in transit light-curve fits, which is foundational for accurate transit timing measurements.

**Methodological Inspiration**

1.  **Coefficient Selection**: For modeling TESS light curves of WD 1856+534, the user must use the DA coefficients from **Table 99–104** (for Kepler/TESS/Gaia passband group) or the specific TESS tables. The four-term law (Eq. 6) should be prioritized.
    
2.  **Gravity-Darkening Consideration**: If the user plans to model any ellipsoidal modulation or tidal distortion in the light curve (which could affect timing), the provided GDCs (e.g., Table 105) are essential. The separated terms allow easy incorporation of a fitted  $\beta_1$ .
    
3.  **Error Budgeting**: The paper highlights that differences in LDCs due to composition are larger than typical semi-empirical errors from high-quality light curves. This implies that even if the exact atmospheric composition of WD 1856+534 is uncertain, the DA coefficients are a valid and necessary choice.
    

**Gap Filling & New Research Directions**

1.  **Gap Filling**: The authors' stated limitation—the lack of 3D convective effects—is a gap the user cannot directly fill. However, the user's project can fill an _application gap_: this paper's coefficients have not been used to model TTVs for a transiting planet around a DA WD. The user's work will be a direct test and application of these theoretical tools.
    
2.  **New Research Directions**:  
    a) **Atmospheric Characterization via Transit Fits**: Use the high-precision TESS light curves and the provided LDCs to fit for the planet's parameters. Any residual systematic structure in the transit shape, after using the four-term law, could be investigated as a potential probe of the WD's atmospheric properties (e.g., hints of pollution or magnetic fields).  
    b) **Joint Analysis with Ellipsoidal Modulation**: If a tidal deformation signal is detectable in the light curve at twice the orbital period, the user could perform a joint fit using the provided GDCs to constrain the WD's  $\beta_1$  and the system's mass ratio, adding constraints to the TTV model.  
    c) **Comparative TTV Analysis**: Compare the TTV amplitudes and models obtained using the simple linear LDC versus the four-term LDC. This would quantify the systematic error introduced by using an inaccurate limb-darkening law in WD exoplanet timing studies.
