### 1 Core Information Summary

**Research Question:** This paper aims to compute limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) and gravity-darkening coefficients (GDCs) for compact stars—specifically DA, DB, and DBA white dwarfs—to improve the modeling of light curves in eclipsing binaries, planetary transits, and other high-precision photometric studies.

**Methodology:** The authors computed model atmospheres for DA (hydrogen-dominated), DB (helium-dominated), and DBA (mixed hydrogen-helium) white dwarfs, covering effective temperatures  $T_{\text{eff}}$  from 3750 K to 100 000 K and surface gravities  $\log g$  from 5.0 to 9.5. They generated specific intensity distributions using 20  $\mu$  points, convolved with passbands of Sloan, UBVRI, HiPERCAM, Kepler, TESS, and Gaia. LDCs were fitted using six limb-darkening laws via the least-squares method. GDCs were derived from a more general equation that includes the partial derivative  $(\partial \ln I_c(\lambda)/\partial \ln g)_{T_{\text{eff}}}$ .

**Core Findings:**

1.  The four-term limb-darkening law (Eq. 6) provides significantly better fits than simpler biparametric laws, especially near the limb.
    
2.  Gravity-darkening coefficients computed with realistic atmosphere models deviate substantially from the classical blackbody approximation.
    
3.  The paper provides 112 tables of LDCs and GDCs for DA, DB, and DBA models across multiple photometric systems, including first-time calculations for GDCs in white dwarfs.
    

**Stated Limitations/Future Work:** The authors note that 3D convective effects are not yet included but plan to apply their techniques to existing 3D atmosphere grids in future work.

**Relevance Assessment:** **7/10** – The paper provides essential atmospheric coefficients for white dwarfs, which are directly applicable to transit light‑curve modeling of WD 1856+534 b, though the study does not specifically address planetary transits or TTVs.

**Project Implications:**

1.  The tabulated LDCs and GDCs can be used to accurately model the transit light curves of WD 1856+534 b, especially when fitting ingress/egress shapes.
    
2.  The recommendation to use the four‑term limb‑darkening law (Eq. 6) should be followed for high‑precision TTV analyses.
    
3.  The results highlight that blackbody‑based approximations are inadequate for precise white‑dwarf transit modeling—realistic atmosphere coefficients must be adopted.
