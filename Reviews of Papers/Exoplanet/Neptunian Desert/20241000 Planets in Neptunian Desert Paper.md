### 1 Core Information Summary

**Research Question:**  
This paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting exoplanet TOI-3568 b, a super-Neptune located within the sub-Jovian desert, to investigate its properties and the mechanisms shaping this sparsely populated region of the mass–period parameter space.

**Methodology:**

*   **Data Sources:** TESS photometry, ground-based follow-up photometry (WCWO), high-resolution optical spectra from MAROON-X (Gemini North), and near-infrared spectropolarimetry from SPIRou (CFHT).
    
*   **Methods:** Joint Bayesian MCMC analysis of photometry and radial velocities to determine planetary and orbital parameters; spectroscopic analysis to characterize the host star; assessment of photoevaporation status using an energy diagram.
    

**Core Findings:**

1.  TOI-3568 b is a hot super-Neptune with  $M_p = 26.4 \pm 1.0 \, M_\oplus$ ,  $R_p = 5.30 \pm 0.27 \, R_\oplus$ , and a low bulk density of  $0.98 \pm 0.15 \, \text{g cm}^{-3}$ , indicating a H/He-rich envelope with a core mass between 10–25  $M_\oplus$ .
    
2.  The planet lies within the sub-Jovian desert, in a transitional region between hot Jupiters and super-Earths, and experiences one of the highest EUV luminosities among planets with  $M_p < 2 \, M_{\text{Nep}}$ , yet has an evaporation lifetime >5 Gyr.
    
3.  The host star TOI-3568 is a kinematically and chemically thin-disk K dwarf, contrary to prior thick-disk classification, with low magnetic activity and solar metallicity.
    

**Stated Limitations/Future Work:**  
The paper notes that the sparse population in the transition region of the mass–period and energy diagrams cannot be fully explained by photoevaporation alone, suggesting that other formation mechanisms may be at play. A more detailed analysis of this gap is beyond the scope of the current study.

**Relevance Assessment:**  
**9/10** – This paper directly studies a planet within the Neptunian desert, providing detailed characterization and discussing its implications for desert formation mechanisms, making it highly relevant for statistical and evolutionary studies of this region.

**Project Implications:**

1.  Adds a well-characterized super-Neptune to the sparse population of the sub-Jovian desert, useful for statistical analysis.
    
2.  Highlights the role of high EUV flux and photoevaporation in shaping the desert’s lower boundary.
    
3.  Demonstrates the importance of high-precision RV and photometric follow-up for desert population studies.
