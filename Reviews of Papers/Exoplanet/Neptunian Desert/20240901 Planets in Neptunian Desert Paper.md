### 1 Core Information Summary

*   **Research Question:** How does the ultrahot Neptune TOI-3261b, a survivor within the "Hot Neptune Desert," retain its gaseous envelope despite extreme irradiation, and what does its existence reveal about the formation pathways of such rare planets?
    
*   **Methodology:** Uses transit photometry from TESS and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements from HARPS and ESPRESSO to determine planetary parameters. Employs interior structure models and simulations of photoevaporation and tidal stripping (Roche Lobe Overflow) to investigate the planet's evolution and mass-loss history.
    
*   **Core Findings:**
    
    1.  Discovery of TOI-3261b, a Neptune-sized ( $3.82^{+0.42}_{-0.35} R_{\oplus}$ ), ultra-short-period ( $P=0.88$  days) planet with a high mass ( $30.3^{+2.2}_{-2.4} M_{\oplus}$ ) and density ( $3.0^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$  g cm $^{-3}$ ).
        
    2.  The planet has a significant envelope mass fraction of  $5.1\% \pm 2.6\%$ , the second highest among known ultrahot Neptunes. Pure H/He photoevaporation models cannot explain its survival; the envelope must be metal-enriched.
        
    3.  Tidal stripping via Roche Lobe Overflow of a progenitor gas giant (e.g., a Hot Jupiter) is a viable formation mechanism that can reproduce TOI-3261b's current mass and orbit.
        
*   **Stated Limitations/Future Work:** The radial velocity baseline is insufficient to rule out long-period companion planets. Future atmospheric follow-up with JWST and high-resolution spectrographs is proposed to measure composition and test formation scenarios.
    
*   **Relevance Assessment:** 10. This paper is a direct case study of a planet surviving in the Neptunian Desert, discussing its properties and the specific physical mechanisms (photoevaporation, tidal stripping) that create the desert.
    
*   **Project Implications:**
    
    1.  Provides a concrete example of a high-mass, envelope-retaining "desert survivor," highlighting that the desert is not completely empty and its inhabitants have unusual properties.
        
    2.  Suggests that violent dynamical processes like high-eccentricity migration and tidal stripping may be a key formation channel for some Neptune-sized USPs, linking them to Hot Jupiters rather than rocky super-Earths.
        
    3.  Identifies atmospheric metallicity as a crucial observable for distinguishing between formation scenarios (primordial vs. stripped core).

| Paper Title | Relevance to "Planets in Neptunian Desert" & Quick Takeaway |
| --- | --- |
| Surviving in the Hot-Neptune Desert: The Discovery of the Ultrahot Neptune TOI-3261b | **Relevance Score (1-10):** 10 **Is it a 'Must-Read'?** Yes **Quick Takeaway:** TOI-3261b is a high-density, ultrahot Neptune whose survival challenges pure photoevaporation models, suggesting it may be the stripped core of a former Hot Jupiter, highlighting tidal stripping as a key mechanism for creating desert survivors. |
