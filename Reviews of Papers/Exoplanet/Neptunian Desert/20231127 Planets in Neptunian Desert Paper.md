### 1 Core Information Summary

*   **Research Question:** To confirm and characterize the TOI-5126 planetary system, specifically a hot super-Neptune (TOI-5126 b) located within the "hot Neptune desert," and its exterior warm Neptune companion (TOI-5126 c).
    
*   **Methodology:** Utilized transit photometry from TESS and CHEOPS for discovery and radius refinement, supplemented by ground-based photometry (LCOGT) and reconnaissance spectroscopy (TRES, CHIRON). High-resolution imaging (Palomar, WIYN, SAI) and Gaia data were used to rule out false positives. System parameters were determined via global MCMC modeling.
    
*   **Core Findings:**
    
    1.  Confirmation of a multi-planet system hosting TOI-5126 b, a hot super-Neptune ( $R_p = 4.74^{+0.16}_{-0.14} R_{\oplus}$ ,  $P = 5.46$  d,  $T_{eq} \approx 1442$  K) situated in the "hot Neptune desert," and TOI-5126 c, a warm Neptune ( $R_p = 3.86^{+0.17}_{-0.16} R_{\oplus}$ ,  $P = 17.9$  d,  $T_{eq} \approx 971$  K).
        
    2.  TOI-5126 b is an ideal target for atmospheric transmission spectroscopy due to its brightness, high equilibrium temperature (suggesting a cloud-free atmosphere), and high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric (TSM).
        
    3.  Tentative Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) were identified, potentially indicating the presence of an additional, non-transiting planet in the system, though spot-crossing events could also be the cause.
        
*   **Stated Limitations/Future Work:** The TTV signals have low SNR and require further high-precision photometric follow-up to confirm their planetary nature versus stellar activity origin. Radial velocity mass measurements are challenging due to the host star's high rotational velocity.
    
*   **Relevance Assessment:** 8/10. This paper is a direct case study of a planet residing in the "hot Neptune desert," providing a prime candidate for testing formation and evolution theories specific to this population.
    
*   **Project Implications:**
    
    1.  Identifies a high-priority, bright target (TOI-5126 b) for statistical studies of atmospheric properties within the desert.
        
    2.  Highlights an intriguing system for comparative planetology between a desert planet and a non-deset planet around the same star.
        
    3.  Presents the counter-intuitive observation that the inner, hotter planet (b) is _larger_ than the outer, cooler planet (c), which contrasts with simple photoevaporation expectations.
