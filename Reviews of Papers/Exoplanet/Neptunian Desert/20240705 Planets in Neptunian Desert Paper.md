**1 Core Information Summary**

*   **Research Question:** Discovery and characterization of two transiting sub-Saturn exoplanets, TOI-2374 b and TOI-3071 b, located deep within the Neptunian desert, to understand their unusual properties and formation pathways.
    
*   **Methodology:** Used TESS photometry for detection, combined with ground-based follow-up photometry (LCOGT, Brierfield, PEST), high-precision radial velocity monitoring (HARPS, PFS), and high-resolution imaging (SOAR). Planetary parameters were derived from a joint analysis of RVs and photometry. Internal structure and evolution were modeled using MESA.
    
*   **Core Findings:**
    
    1.  Two confirmed sub-Saturns with high masses ( $57 \pm 4 M_{\oplus}$ ,  $68 \pm 4 M_{\oplus}$ ) and radii ( $6.8 \pm 0.3 R_{\oplus}$ ,  $7.2 \pm 0.5 R_{\oplus}$ ), residing well inside the Neptunian desert.
        
    2.  Both planets are extremely metal-rich, with inferred heavy-element masses of  $33.3 \pm 3.8 M_{\oplus}$  (TOI-2374 b) and  $45.1 \pm 5.5 M_{\oplus}$  (TOI-3071 b), challenging standard core accretion formation models.
        
    3.  Photoevaporation simulations show both planets are stable against atmospheric loss due to their high masses and likely high envelope metallicities.
        
*   **Stated Limitations/Future Work:** Notes that atmospheric composition measurements with JWST could further constrain planetary formation and evolution.
    
*   **Relevance Assessment:** **10/10**. This paper is a direct case study of two planets residing in the Neptunian desert, providing key data on their physical properties and discussing formation/evolution mechanisms relevant to the desert's existence.
    
*   **Project Implications:**
    
    1.  Provides concrete examples of massive, metal-rich planets that can survive in the Neptunian desert, suggesting that high core mass and envelope metallicity may be a key factor for stability.
        
    2.  Challenges standard formation models, implying that planetesimal accretion might play a more significant role in forming such planets than previously thought.
        
    3.  Highlights that planets just below Saturn's mass might be a metal-rich transition group, offering a specific population for statistical analysis in the context of the desert.
